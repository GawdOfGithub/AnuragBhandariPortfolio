import { Label } from '@/components/mdx/Labels';
import { VStack, HStack } from '@/components/mdx/Stack';

I started my career as a web developer about **{new Date().getFullYear() - 2016} months ago**. I've tried some programming languages and tech stack, both Back-End, and Front-End.

Even though the scope of web development is broad, I was very interested and focused on **Front-End Development** and **Back-End Development**.

## Front-End Developer

I love creating something that is clean and minimalistic, attractive and has value, and of course, easy to use.

I really enjoy creating webapps at a fast pace  while utilising as much existing tools and templates as possiible,some of my favourite front-end tools:
- **React-JS**,
- **TypeScript**,
-  **NEXT-JS**,
-  **Tailwind**,
- **Shad-CN**
- and others.

I would like to tell you that why do I use these tools?

### TypeScript

First of all, the programming language. I'm very used to using **TypeScript**, although website creation can be done using PHP, Python, etc but as you all know  TypeScript is the Gawd of web,

The JavaScript superset—TypeScript—has accompanied me for **about {new Date().getFullYear() - 2018} months**.

### React

I really enjoy building single page application websites and React is my go-to library.

I've been using it **{new Date().getFullYear() - 2018} months** and have become quite proficient with it.

### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind is my goto library for design since the start of my web development career I am using tailwind 

### Shad CN

Shad cn UI boasts a collection of pre-built components that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also meticulously crafted for optimal accessibility.

### Next.js

React powered, SEO-friendly, blazing fast. Build sites & apps with server-side magic next.js. Next level, indeed.**

## Backend-Development

I primarily leverage the Node.js environment offered by Next.js for my backend development, utilizing ServerActions to facilitate efficient and seamless backend development processes 

These are the  tools that I use  frequently  for backend development:
-  **TypeScript**,
-  **NEXT-JS**,
-  **Server Actions**,
-  **MONGODB**,
-  **Prisma(Learning)**,
-  **PostgressSQL(Learning)**,
-  **MYSQL(Learning)**,
- and others.

## Detail and Summary

I represent all data in labels to make it easier to read. The **underline indicator** shows how often I used the related item, e.g.:
